# TELOS - A Smart Contract Platform for Everyone

Welcome to the official Telos repository! This software enables anyone to rapidly build and deploy high-performance and high-security blockchain-based applications.

Telos offers a suite of features including:

1. Economic disparity solutions such as elimination of whale accounts, inversely weighted voting, and increased token equity.
2. Developer and Enterprise features such as designation of propietary code and reduced RAM speculation.
3. Network freeze mitigation by regularly rotating standby BP's into production status to ensure operability and uptime.
4. Standby and BP payments are straightforward and fair, resulting in a better payment experience.
5. The Telos Constitution is ratified and enforceable at launch.
6. ...more features incoming!

For a full explanation of all the proposed Telos features, be sure to read our whitepaper!

# Installation

1. Clone master branch

    a. `git clone https://github.com/Telos-Foundation/telos`

    b. `git checkout stage2.0`

    c. `git submodule update --init --recursive`

2. Inside the telos folder run the following commands:

    a. `./telos_build.sh`

    b. `sudo ./telos_install.sh`

3. Set up config.ini file

    a. Run nodeos to generate a config file. This will generate a config.ini file in the current directory if none exists.

        nodeos --config-dir ./

    b. Determine your Producer name. Please be aware there are restrictions on the allowed characters.

        producer-name = prodname1234

    b. Determine your Signature Provider. Run `teclos create key`, and import your keys into your wallet.

        signature-provider = TLOS{public key}=KEY:{private key}

    c. Determine your p2p and http endpoints. Choose your own p2p and http ports.

        http-server-address = 0.0.0.0:{http port}
        p2p-listen-endpoint = 0.0.0.0:{p2p port}
        p2p-server-address = {external IP address}:{p2p port}
        p2p-peer-address = testnet.telosfoundation.io:6789

    d. Determine your Plugins. The only required plugin is producer_plugin, but other plugins add extended functionality to your nodes.

        plugin = eosio::http_plugin
        plugin = eosio::chain_plugin
        plugin = eosio::chain_api_plugin
        plugin = eosio::history_plugin
        plugin = eosio::history_api_plugin
        plugin = eosio::net_plugin
        plugin = eosio::net_api_plugin
        plugin = eosio::producer_plugin

4. Register Node on Testnet

    a. Navigate to testnet.telosfoundation.io and click on the Register button.

    b. Enter your configuration into the web form.

    c. Copy the command generated by submitting the form.

    d. Run the generated `regproducer` command on your local node.

    e. Your account is now created and registered as a producer on the testnet.

# Testnet Contributions

The Telos Testnet is a sandbox for testing newly implemented features and finding bugs within the network. In order to ensure the network behaves as expected, participation in Testnet activites and providing meaningful feedback is encouraged. 

* __Voting__ Voting is an important part of the network, and with Telos' proposed changes to the voting stucture each vote will carry more weight and whales will have significantly less influence on the direction of the network. 

* __Claiming Producer/Standby Rewards__ In order to receive your hard-earned Producer/Standby payout, registered producers will make a call to `claimrewards` no more than once per day. When `claimrewards` is called, the calling producer's share of TLOS is calculated and paid to their account. In addition to sending the producer's earned payout, `claimrewards` will also make a deposit to the Worker Proposal Fund. This deposit is not taken out of the producer's share, but rather from the newly minted tokens from the claimrewards call. For a more in depth explanation of this process, please consult the whitepaper or join a discussion on our many public channels.

# Testnet Road Map
The Telos Roadmap is broken into four separate stages. Each stage implements new features outlined in the white paper. Once all the features of a stage have been implemented, tested, and peer reviewed, the group will move onto implementing the next stage. Each stage may contain versions.
